### Short answer
- Yes: treat a “clinic” as a clinic/independent practice (tenant). This supports both solo psychologists and multi-psychologist clinics.
- Use `clinic_members.role` for staff roles (owner/admin/psychologist). Keep patients as their own entity (not clinic members) to avoid granting clinic-internal access.

### Recommended setup

- Tenant model
  - Clinic = clinic or solo practice. On sign up, a solo psychologist creates their own `clinic` and becomes `owner`.
  - Clinics invite additional psychologists as `clinic_members` with role `psychologist` (or `admin`).

- Roles and access
  - Staff roles in `clinic_members.role`: `owner`, `admin`, `psychologist`.
  - Patients should NOT be `clinic_members`. Model patients separately, optionally with a linked `users` account for a portal.
  - Add a small helper to check roles before rendering pages or executing actions, based on the current user’s membership in the current clinic.

- Data model additions (minimal)
  - Patients:
    - `patients`: `id`, `clinicId`, `primaryPsychologistUserId` (or a join table for multi-assign), `status` (active|inactive), name/email/phone, timestamps.
    - Optional: `patient_users`: link a `users.id` to a `patient.id` if you offer a portal.
  - Appointments:
    - `appointments`: `id`, `clinicId`, `psychologistUserId`, `patientId`, `start`, `end`, `status` (scheduled|completed|canceled), notes visibility.
  - Payments for sessions:
    - `appointment_payments`: `id`, `clinicId`, `patientId`, `appointmentId`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`.

### How this fits your two cases

- Independent psychologist
  - Signs up → new `clinic` with role `owner`.
  - Can add up to 5 active patients on free plan; beyond that, upgrade prompt.
  - Takes payments per appointment via Checkout.

- Clinic with multiple psychologists
  - One `clinic` owned by clinic; invite staff as `psychologist`/`admin`.
  - All patients and appointments scoped by `clinicId`. Each appointment links to a specific psychologist.
  - Billing is one subscription on the clinic; appointment payments still per patient.

### Minimal implementation steps in this template
- Define new tables: `patients`, `appointments`, `appointment_payments` (all with `clinicId`).
- Add a helper to get the current membership role and guard routes/actions (use `getClinicForUser()` and the current user’s `clinic_members.role`).
- Update UI to show psychologist-only pages based on membership role.
- Enforce free tier limit by counting active patients on create/reactivate.
- Add simple Stripe Checkout for appointments, saving `payment_intent_id`.

If you want, I can add the schema for patients/appointments/payments and a small `requireMemberRole(['owner','psychologist'])` helper next, so you can start building the psychologist pages immediately.
